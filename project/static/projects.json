    "longDescription": "This project was designed to learn the basics of software development and web technology. It is a simple website hosted on GCloud to demonstrate what I have learned. The website allows to add projects I have been working on with a title, picture, short- and long description.\nTo achieve my goals of learning how to start a software and web development project I have participated in the SE Foundations course offered by CODE. The course was offered during the Spring Semester 2021. It included a 7 week learning phase with classes and a 4 week project phase. During the whole 11 weeks we had feedback groups every week to answer questions and help peers."
